Example traffic
Request by an end-user's browser

This user wants to access the web site "www.freebsd.org", so they type in http://www.freebsd.org into their browser and hit enter. After the usual DNS resolution to find the IP address for www.freebsd.org, a connection is initiated via TCP to the web server (SYN; SYN,ACK; ACK). The very next thing to be sent to the web server by the browser/client is the following plain text request:


GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.freebsd.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3
Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive
If-Modified-Since: Mon, 09 May 2005 21:01:30 GMT
If-None-Match: "26f731-8287-427fcfaa"
The server knows the browser/client is done with its traffic when it receives a blank line with a carriage return + line feed (\r\n).

Response from the server

The response is also in plain text:


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 13 May 2005 05:51:12 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.x LaHonda (Unix)
Last-Modified: Fri, 13 May 2005 05:25:02 GMT
ETag: "26f725-8286-42843a2e"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 33414
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html
The browser/client now knows that text/html is coming, and here it is:


<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html>
<!-- Rest of the HTML Page Here -->
</html>
The browser/client knows the server is done sending its html (or data for non-html) when it receives a blank line with a carriage return + line feed (\r\n).
